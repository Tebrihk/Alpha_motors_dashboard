# Alpha_motors_dashboard

# Overview
Alpha Motors is a machine learning-based car price prediction and analytics dashboard built using Streamlit, Scikit-learn, and Plotly. It allows users to analyze car prices, track depreciation trends, and predict the price of used cars based on key features like brand, year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, and transmission.

# Features

 Pricing Analysis – View car price distributions, average prices by brand, and mileage impact.

 Depreciation Trends – See how car values decrease over time and find brands with the best resale value.

 Car Price Prediction – Predict the estimated price of a used car using a trained Random Forest Regressor model.

 User-friendly Dashboard – Built with Streamlit for easy navigation and interactive visualizations.

 #  Dataset
The project uses a CSV file (Alpha_Motors.csv) containing historical car listing data with attributes such as:
Make (Car Brand)
Year of Manufacture
Condition
Mileage
Engine Size
Fuel Type
Transmission
Price

Ensure that Alpha_Motors.csv is placed in the root directory of the project.
